Резервы по обременительным договорам (SDXXXXXXXX);  X.    К одной схеме отражения выручки по ДЦИ (сч.XX), две схемы налогового учета: продажа товара и реализация СМР:  -        разные принципы отражения операций в БУ и НУ, включая ставки НДС при использовании «работы» для целей продажи оборудования по торговой схеме;  -        возможность разделения/объединения позиций номенклатуры после начала работы с этими позициям;  -        Задача поставки оборудования через XX счет по уже начатам поставкам (текущая Боливия).  X.    Признание выручки и корректировка выручки по сч.XX должна осуществляться одним документом только последней датой месяца по курсу на последний день месяца. Документ должен предусматривать возможность отражения выручки как в «+», так и в «-»;  X.    Прослеживаемость товаров (поставка оборудования в рамках СМР) (SDXXXXXXXX);  X.    Некорректные акты сверки;  X.    Проверить работу системы с резервами по гарантийным обязательствам: начисление, использование, инвентаризация (доначисление/сторнирование) и восстановление.   Не менее важные вопросы, требующие решения:  X.    Операции субподряда с давальческим учетом (SDXXXXXXXX);  X.    По отражению выручки с использованием счета XX:  -        При определении рублевого эквивалента ЧП по валютным договорам, предусмотреть возможность выбора процента аванса;  -        При продлении срока действия этапа / договора дата автоматически не меняется в связанных документах, её надо менять везде вручную (заказ клиента, ГАУ, заказ на производство, этапы)  X.

ГСПИ в XXXX году получены две лицензии на разработку месторождений строительного камня и песчано-гравийной смеси. Строительный камень будет использоваться как камень, так и перерабатываться в щебень разной фракции. В основном камень и щебень будут использоваться на возведение дорог по проекту строительства АСММ (атомной станции малой мощности), но будет и частичная продажа готовой продукции (камень, щебень) на сторону. В марте XXXX года приступили к разработке карьера, первый камень будет оприходован в апреле. Мы понимаем, что за март нам нужно сдать нулевую декларацию по НДПИ. Поскольку мы начинаем процесс с чистого листа нам необходимо получить механизмы по работе с готовой продукцией (счет XX), существующие в XС. Попробуем подстроиться под то, что есть, насколько получится.
